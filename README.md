# Haberci - News App
This project is another personal project that uses Haberler API from [collectAPI.com](https://collectapi.com/tr/api/news/haberler-api). The project started with a home page design on Figma. I wondered how it would be if news websites started to use TikTok-like feeds. With the design impressing me, I had to create it.

### What I learned

This project is my first time using a ".env" file to store my API key. Using it with React JS and Netlify is a thing I learned from this project.
Also, creating cool shapes on the search page using gradients and background-size was cool. How they turned out made my day :)

### Useful resources
